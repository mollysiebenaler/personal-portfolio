## What did I learn?
Creating this personal portfolio for BAIS:3300 allowed me to practice my CSS and HTML skills in an in-depth format. 

---

## How did I create?
To create this website, I downloaded a free bootstrap temaplate.  I then filled in my personal information in the HTML code, validating along the way.  To publish the site under mollysiebenaler.me, I had to connect this repository to MIcrosoft Azure.
